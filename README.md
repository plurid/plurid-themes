# Plurid Apps Themes


There are 4 base themes and multiple, plurid-based product themes.

The 4 base themes consist of:

+ night
+ dusk
+ dawn
+ light

where the lightness increases from the first to the last.

A theme cam be further more classified based on the theme type, `bright` or `dark`. A `dark` theme will have the primary color darker than the secondary color, whereas a `bright` theme will have the primary color brighter than the secondary color.
